### **In this directory, I would like to share the 1st place solution at Kaggle BirdCLEF 2021 competition.**

<br>

To overview our solution, please check here.

'solutionへのリンク'

In short, our solution is composed of the three stage training.

<br>

### 1st stage

Making melspectrogram classifier (0:nocall, 1:somebird singing) from freefield1010 data. (hereinafter referred to as "nocall detector")
Then calibrating 2nd stage input data by that. We make 2nd stage input labels weighted with call probablility.

(freefield1010 - https://academictorrents.com/details/d247b92fa7b606e0914367c0839365499dd20121)

<br>

### 2nd stage

Melspectrogram multilabel classifier to identify which birds are singing in a clip(7sec).

training: train_short_audio data

validation: train_soundscapes data

<br>

### 3rd stage

Candidate extraction from 2nd stage output (five birds extracted per clip(7sec))
The train_metadata is added as features and then classification for each of candidates (0:unlikely 1:likely) is performed by lightgbm.

training: train_short_audio data

validation: train_soundscapes data

<br>

### **To reproduce the result, please follow the steps below.**

<br>

## 1. BUILD NOCALL DETECTOR

We use the nocall detector for the following two purposes.

A. To calibrate 2nd stage input data. 

B. To attach labels to 3rd stage input data. At this time, threshold was 0.5 (hard labeling).

<br>

Check the code below.

## 2. CALIBRATE 2ND STAGE INPUT DATA & BUILD MELSPECTROGRAM MULTILABEL CLASSIFIER & USE IT FOR TRAIN_SHORT_AUDIO & TRAIN_SOUNDSCAPES
